## 1. Testing the Enhanced `status` Command

The `status` command is your new go-to for mid-day context recovery. It gives you a complete snapshot of what you're working on.

### How to Use
Simply run:
```bash
status
```

### What to Check
- **üß≠ WHERE YOU ARE:** Shows your current directory, git branch (if any), and the very last journal entry you made.
- **üìù TODAY'S JOURNAL:** Lists all journal entries you've made since midnight.
- **üöÄ ACTIVE PROJECT:** If you're inside a `~/Projects` subdirectory, it shows the project name and the last git commit message.
- **‚úÖ TASKS:** Your current to-do list.

### Test Plan
1.  **Inside a Project:**
    -   `cd` into one of your projects under `~/Projects`.
    -   Make sure it's a git repository.
    -   Run `status`.
    -   **Expected:** You should see the project name, git branch, and last commit message.

2.  **Outside a Project:**
    -   `cd ~`
    -   Run `status`.
    -   **Expected:** The "ACTIVE PROJECT" section should indicate you're not in a project directory.

3.  **With Fresh Journal Entries:**
    -   Add a new journal entry: `journal "Testing the new status command."`
    -   Run `status`.
    -   **Expected:** Your new entry should appear under "TODAY'S JOURNAL" and as the "Last journal entry".

## 2. Testing the Enhanced `goodevening` Command

The `goodevening` command is designed to be a powerful end-of-day ritual to close out your work.

Run at the end of your day:
```bash
goodevening
```

### What to Check
- **‚úÖ COMPLETED TODAY:** Shows tasks you've marked as done today.

### Test Plan
1.  **Prepare the Test:**
    -   Add a task: `todo add "Test the goodevening script"`
    -   Complete the task: `todo done 1` (or the correct number)
    -   `cd` into a project under `~/Projects` and create a new file or modify one without committing.
    -   `cd ~` (run `goodevening` from your home directory).

2.  **Run the Command:**
    -   Run `goodevening`.
    -   **Expected:**
        -   You should see the task you just completed under "COMPLETED TODAY".
        -   You should see the project with uncommitted changes listed.
        -   You should be prompted for a note.

3.  **Verify the Note:**
    -   Enter a message like "Tested goodevening script." at the prompt.

## 3. Testing the `projects` Command

This command helps you find and get details about projects you haven't touched in a while.

### How to Use
-   To find old projects: `projects forgotten`
-   To get details on a project: `projects recall <project_name>`

### Test Plan
1.  **Find Forgotten Projects:**
    -   Run `projects forgotten`.
    -   **Expected:** A list of projects in `~/Projects` that haven't been modified in over 60 days. (This list might be empty if all your projects are active).

2.  **Recall a Project:**
    -   Pick a project name from the `forgotten` list (or any project in `~/Projects`).
    -   Run `projects recall <project_name>`.
    -   **Expected:** You should see a summary card with the project's last modification date, last commit, a preview of its README, and its full path.

## 4. Testing the `blog` Command

This is your new toolkit for managing your blog content workflow.

### How to Use
-   `blog status`: Get an overview of your blog.
-   `blog stubs`: List all posts marked as "content stubs".
-   `blog random`: Open a random stub file for editing.
-   `blog recent`: See recently modified posts.

### Test Plan
1.  **Check Status:**
    -   Run `blog status`.
    -   **Expected:** See total post count, number of stubs, and the date of the last update to the blog repository.

2.  **List and Edit Stubs:**
    -   Run `blog stubs`.
    -   **Expected:** A list of all markdown files containing the phrase "content stub".
    -   Run `blog random`.
    -   **Expected:** It should tell you which file it's opening and then open it in VS Code (if installed) or the default editor.

3.  **Check Recent Posts:**
    -   Open any blog post file in `~/Projects/my-ms-ai-blog/content/posts/` and save it (even with no changes) to update its modification time.
    -   Run `blog recent`.
    -   **Expected:** The file you just saved should appear at the top of the list.
