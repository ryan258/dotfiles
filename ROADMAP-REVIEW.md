This document contains the details of the roadmap items that have been implemented as of October 2025.

## ‚úÖ Priority 1: Mid-Day Context Recovery (Completed)
**Problem:** When focus is lost, `status` doesn't show enough to recover context

**Enhanced `status` shows:**
```
üß≠ WHERE YOU ARE:
  ‚Ä¢ Current directory: [pwd]
  ‚Ä¢ Current git branch: [if in git repo]
  ‚Ä¢ Last journal entry: [most recent with timestamp]
  
üìù TODAY'S JOURNAL (since midnight):
  [all entries from today]
  
üöÄ ACTIVE PROJECT:
  ‚Ä¢ [project name from current directory]
  ‚Ä¢ Last commit: [if in git repo]
  
‚úÖ TASKS:
  [numbered list]
  
üí° Commands: journal | todo | startday | goodevening
```

**Files modified:**
- `~/dotfiles/scripts/status.sh` (created)
- `~/dotfiles/zsh/aliases.zsh` (updated)

## ‚úÖ Priority 2: Evening Close-Out (Completed)
**Problem:** `goodevening` exists but isn't valuable enough to use

**Enhanced `goodevening` does:**
1. Show completed tasks from today (`~/.todo_done.txt` with today's date)
2. Show today's journal entries
3. List active projects with uncommitted changes
4. Prompt: "What should tomorrow-you remember about today?"
5. Add response to journal automatically
6. Clear completed tasks older than 7 days

**Files modified:**
- `~/dotfiles/scripts/goodevening.sh`

---

## ‚úÖ Priority 3: Forgotten Project Recovery (Completed)
**Problem:** No visibility into projects built months ago

**New command:** `projects forgotten`
**New command:** `projects recall <name>`

**Files created:**
- `~/dotfiles/scripts/projects.sh`
- Alias added to `~/dotfiles/zsh/aliases.zsh`

---

## ‚úÖ October 2025: Clipboard & Context Docs
**Problem:** Clipboard workflows were tribal knowledge and hard to recall during brain fog.

**Deliverables:**
- `docs/clipboard.md` with end-to-end `pbcopy`/`pbpaste` pipelines and real-world examples.
- Cross-links added to `README.md`, `scripts/README.md`, and `scripts/README_aliases.md`.

**Impact:** Faster "copy, transform, share" flows without leaving the keyboard‚Äîsupports low-energy days and pairs well with `graballtext`.
